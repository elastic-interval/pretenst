# Growth

The *Galapagotchi* bodies are made up of [intervals](interval.md), combined to make triangles, and then extended **tripod-by-tripod** creating new tetrahedrons.  This is how the *gotchi* bodies grow.

### Bilateral symmetry

There is a special feature of the growth process in *Galapagotchi* bodies. They grow with bilateral symmetry.

Growing bilaterally is something extra which helps bodies walk in a more familiar way, and represents a bit of unapologetic **intelligent design** here. It's an advantage introduced through a bit of programming.
